        <p>
            I, Marcus Jones Jr., was born in Central Michigan
            on <strong>Feburary 4th of 2007.</strong> <br> I have lived in Michigan
            for the majority of my life until my family moved down
            to Northwest Ohio to live closer to my grandparents.
            I enjoy spending time with my friends and
            relaxing after a hard day's work.<br>

            I find fitness to be a really fun way to pass the time because it allows me to put my energy into something
            useful
            and improve my health. I have been playing videogames since I was a kid and they
            are really cool to me for many different reasons. I enjoy almost every kind of game from platformers to
            shooters to rpgs. Videogames capture my attention through competition and/or fantasy. I find it really
            enjoyable to climb my way up leaderboards in competitive games or be someone else for a while when playing
            rpgs. I enjoy many different types of music and I think that it is really effective way of expressing
            yourself.

        <h3>Goals</h3>

        <div class="goallist">
            <!--The ul element creates a bullet point list-->
            <ul>
                <li>Attain a degree in computer programming</li>
                <li>Get a job that involves programming</li>
                <li>Purchase my own home/property</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <p>
            I plan to attain a computer programming degree from
            <span id="nscc"><a href="https://northweststate.edu/"> Northwest State Community College</a></span>
            after graduating from Four County. I see programming being my career for the rest
            of my life. I would like to own a house because I have never lived on a piece of
            property that my family actually owns and I think it would be nice to have a place
            to stay that is truly my own.
