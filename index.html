       <h3>About Me</h3> 
      
       <p>
         I, Marcus Jones Jr., was born in Central Michigan
         on Feburary 4th of 2007. <br> I have lived in Michigan
         for the majority of my life until my family moved down 
         to Northwest Ohio to live closer to my grandparents.
         I enjoy spending time with my friends and
         relaxing after a hard day's work. 
         </p>

       <h3>Interest</h3> 
        
       <p> 
            The main things I find interesting are fitness and videogames
            and they share two things in common 
            that sparks my interest for them.
            
            
            <ul>
              
                <li>They are <em>dynamic</em></li>
                <li>They are <em>rewarding</em></li>
                <li>They are <em>motivating</em></li>
                
            </ul>



              fitness and videogames are are always changing and reward
               you for spending time on them. The feeling of
              ranking up on a game, hitting a new PR in the gym, 
              or improving my mile time are all very satisfiying to me because
              they are the direct result of my time and effort. What makes
              me call these interesting instead of enjoyable is the fact that
              it is easy to lose progress if I'm not giving them any attention. 
            
       <h3>Goals</h3> 
         I plan to attain my computer programming degree
            after getting my four county certificate.
         I find programming so intriguing that I would like to
         hold a job as a programmer for the rest of my life. I would also like to
         own a house in the future because I have lived in apartments
         all my life and they aren't very customizable and their 
          space is very limited.
