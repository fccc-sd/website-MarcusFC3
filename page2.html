        <h3>Why I Chose Fitness</h3>
        <!--All p elements contain the main text of my page-->
        <p>
            While I can say that while fitness has postively 
            impacted almost every part of my life, It was very difficult to start.
            I used to see fitness as something you'd only do to improve your physique, and to do so you would 
            have to endure a large amount of pain. Seeing fitness as trading mild to strong discomfort 
            to better the way you look just isn't very appealing or sustainable for me as it can take years to 
            develop the look you want. I found that fitness gives plenty of intangable benefits upon consistent performance 
            like higher levels of confidence and just
            feeling satisfied with myself. I also found that fitness can be made into something enjoyable 
            instead of monotonously performing exercises and seeing the challenge as a downside, measuring my progress and
            striving to break my own records gives my workouts a sense of purpose that motivates me.

            My top 3 sports are basketball, baseball, and football.
            Because I'm from Michigan, I'm always rooting for Detroit in every sport, no matter how often they disapoint me. 
            Currently I am excited to watch the Detroit lions during the 2023-2024 NFL season because they may 
            actually have a shot at a deep playoff run this year. I don't watch too much baseball because it isn't 
            as fun to watch as other sports but going to baseball games in person and playing baseball are both really fun. 
            Basketball might be my favorite sport of the three because I have played and watched it for the longest. 
            While I always want detroit to win whenever I'm watching, I don't really follow a single team when watching basketball.
            I have never played organized basketball, baseball or football. The only sport I have ever offically particpated in was 
            track and field at Tinora High School as a long distance runner and while I did enjoy my time on the team, I prefer to run alone.
